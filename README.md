# dog-similarity-predictions

Develop Play-Date app for Dogs using dog images and user requirements(text), using Artificial Intelligence and deploy on cloud. For the task developed combined approach of both Convolutional neural networks and Recurrent neural networks called Recurrent-Convolutional Network. 

# Project Components
1. CNN model for extract image features.
2. RNN model for extract text features.
3. RCN model for combine image features and text features.
3. Create Inference model using TensorflowLite.
5. Deploy the app on Heroku.
